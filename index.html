<h3>Exxon Withdraws ITEP Application <small>1/28/2019</small></h3>
<img class="thumbnail" src="https://cdn.exxonmobil.com/~/media/global/images/supporting-images/refineries/baton-rouge-facilities_supporting_image.jpg?as=1&h=536&w=716">
<p>News broke last week that sent shockwaves through the Louisiana business community, Exxon announced that it would pull its applications filed under ITEP (Industrial Tax Exemption Program).  The announcement from the #2 company on the Fortune 500 List came after the East Baton Rouge Parish School Board denied Exxon's ITEP application.  The vote from the school board denying Exxon's forms has now placed a new strain on what has thus far been a rather successful relationship between the state of Louisiana and Exxon in the 100+ years the company has done business in the state.  Exxon released a statement verifying the stress that the school board's decision created by saying that the decisions made by the company regarding future investments in projects will no longer take into account tax breaks such as those provided by ITEP.  While highly unlikely that Exxon completely withdraws its dealings from Louisiana it is quite possible that this unfolding of events will likely hurt Louisiana's chances of winning future investments from the company. </p>

<h3>Topgolf Opens in Baton Rouge <small>1/21/2019</small></h3>
<img class="thumbnail" src="https://topgolf.com/assets/kobalt/TG_Omaha.jpg">
<p>Topgolf opened its doors to the Baton Rouge public on Friday, January 11 at its location at Siegen Lane Marketplace. Topgolf is a chain-brand that has experienced large success at locations throughout the country since its creation.  The investment of a national chain into a large facility in Baton Rouge is a sign of a stablized local economy.  Topgolf will cater to multiple people in the Baton Rouge area from clients such as children and families, business or corporate events, date nights, or other similar events.  The opening of Topgolf is a good sign of Baton Rouge growing on a national level; however, it remains to be seen whether the hype and excitement of the first opening weeks will continue for years to come.  </p>

<h3>"Poor" Ranking Refuted by Louisiana Economic Development <small>1/20/2019</small></h3>
<img class="thumbnail" src="https://www.opportunitylouisiana.com/images/default-source/boards-and-reports/led-boards-reports_meeting-notices-992x640.jpg?sfvrsn=4">
<p>A ranking published by 24/7 Wall Street ranked Louisiana as one of the poorest states in terms of income and growth.  Leaders with the Louisiana Economic Development simply rebuffed these claims stating "increased GDP", "27,500 more jobs since 2016", and "$30.7 billion in economic investment" (LED Secretary Don Pierson).  Although Pierson is truthful in those statements jobs and investments offer very little in the way of diversifying the state's economy.  Louisiana's economy has largely revolved around resources (oil and gas, chemicals, etc.) for much of its existence.  While a healthy industry of plants is a strong suit of Louisiana more needs to be done than simply celebrating every time a company announces a new plant for the Mississippi's banks.  A healthy economy would include new jobs in technology, finance, and many other fields suitable for college graduates.  One of the largest contributors to Louisiana's poor economic situation is the "bleeding" of talented, qualified students from LSU and other universities in state to Texas.  Keeping our local talent home and in-state would go a long way into setting up a bright future for the state. </p>
